class BaseAttack(abc.ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for black-box attacks against language models.

    This class provides the foundational interface and structure that all
    attack implementations must follow. It handles common initialization
    patterns and enforces a consistent API across different attack types.

    Attributes:
        config: A dictionary containing configuration settings for the attack.

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):

        Initializes the attack with configuration parameters.

        Args:
            config: A dictionary containing configuration settings for the attack.
                Must include all required parameters for the specific attack type.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If config is not a dictionary.
            ValueError: If required configuration parameters are missing or invalid.

        Validates the provided configuration.

        This method is called after configuration validation and provides
        an opportunity for subclasses to perform initialization tasks such
        as loading models, creating output directories, or setting up logging.

        Executes the attack logic.

        This abstract method must be implemented by all attack subclasses
        to define their specific attack methodology and execution flow.

        Args:
            **kwargs: Attack-specific arguments that vary by implementation.
                Common examples include:
                - input_prompts: List of prompts to test

        Returns:

            typically includes:

            - success_metrics: Attack success rates and statistics
            - detailed_results: Comprehensive result data (e.g., pandas DataFrame)
            - attack_report: Summary of attack performance

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented by a subclass.
            RuntimeError: If the attack execution fails due to configuration

Attack module for HackAgent security assessment framework.

This package contains various attack implementations designed to test the security
and robustness of AI agents and language models. The attacks are built on a common
base class and follow established patterns for extensibility and maintainability.

Available attacks:
- AdvPrefix: Adversarial prefix generation attacks using uncensored and target models
- Base attack classes and utilities for implementing new attack types
- Strategy pattern implementations for flexible attack execution

The module integrates with the HackAgent backend for result tracking and reporting.

Attack strategy implementations using the Strategy pattern.

This module provides different attack strategies that can be executed against victim agents.
The Strategy pattern allows for dynamic selection and execution of various attack methodologies,
each with their own specific configurations and execution logic.

The module includes:
- Abstract base class `AttackStrategy` defining the interface
- Concrete implementations like `AdvPrefix` for adversarial prefix attacks
- Helper methods for HTTP response handling and data parsing
- Integration with the HackAgent backend API for attack execution and result tracking

AdvPrefix attack implementation package.

This package contains the modular components for implementing adversarial prefix
generation attacks. The attack pipeline consists of multiple stages including
prefix generation, evaluation, filtering, and selection.

Modules:
- config: Configuration settings and default parameters
- generate: Prefix generation using uncensored models
- compute_ce: Cross-entropy computation and scoring
- completions: Target model completion generation
- evaluation: Attack success evaluation and scoring
- preprocessing: Input preprocessing and validation
- aggregation: Result aggregation across multiple runs
- selection: Final prefix selection based on success metrics
- utils: Utility functions and helpers

# Suppress pandas FutureWarnings specifically for groupby operations

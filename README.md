## Overview

HackAgent is an open-source toolkit designed to help security researchers, developers and AI safety practitioners evaluate the security of AI agents. 
It provides a structured approach to discover potential vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, jailbreaking techniques, and other attack vectors.

## üî• Features

- **Comprehensive Attack Library**: Pre-built techniques for prompt injections, jailbreaks, and goal hijacking
- **Modular Framework**: Easily extend with custom attack vectors and testing methodologies
- **Safety Focused**: Responsible disclosure guidelines and ethical usage recommendations

### üîå AI Agent Frameworks Supported

[![ElizaOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/ElizaOS-purple?style=flat&logo=robot)](https://elizaos.ai)
[![ADK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google-ADK-green?style=flat&logo=openai)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)

## üöÄ Installation


### Installation from PyPI

HackAgent can be installed directly from PyPI:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install hackagent

# Or with Poetry
poetry add hackagent
```

## üìö Quick Start (Google ADK)

```python
from hackagent import HackAgent

# Initialize the agent tester with API key
agent = HackAgent(
    name="multi_tool_agent",
    endpoint="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="your_api_key_here",  # Or omit to use HACKAGENT_API_KEY environment variable
    agent_type=AgentTypeEnum.GOOGLE_ADK
)

# Run a basic security scan
agent.hack(
    attack_vectors=[
        AttackVectors.PROMPT_INJECTION,
        AttackVectors.INDIRECT_JAILBREAK,
        AttackVectors.GOAL_HIJACKING
    ],
    verbosity=2
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Attack Vectors

HackAgent includes implementations for several attack vectors:

| Attack Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Prompt Injection | Techniques to manipulate AI system prompts |
| Indirect Jailbreak | Methods that circumvent safety guardrails |
| Goal Hijacking | Approaches to redirect AI agent objectives |
| System Prompt Leaking | Extraction of system instructions |
| Response Manipulation | Methods to generate unintended responses |

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Security Scan

```python
from hackagent import HackAgent

# Initialize with API details for the target
agent = HackAgent(
    target_api="https://api.example.com/v1",
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

# Run a comprehensive security scan
results = agent.scan_all()
```

### Custom Attack Vector

```python
from hackagent import HackAgent, AttackVector

# Define a custom attack vector
class MyCustomAttack(AttackVector):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="My Custom Attack", 
                         description="Tests for specific vulnerability")
        
    def execute(self, target):
        # Attack implementation
        return results

# Use your custom attack
agent = HackAgent(target="target_model")
agent.register_attack_vector(MyCustomAttack())
agent.run_specific_attack("My Custom Attack")
```

## üìä Reporting

HackAgent automatically sends test results to the VistLabs dashboard for analysis and visualization. All reports can be accessed through your dashboard account.

```python
# Run a security scan - results are automatically sent to the dashboard
results = agent.scan_all()

# Get a URL to view the report on the dashboard
report_url = agent.get_report_url(results.id)
print(f"View your report at: {report_url}")
```

### Dashboard Features

- Comprehensive visualization of attack results
- Historical data comparison
- Vulnerability severity ratings
- Recommended mitigations
- Export capabilities for reports
- Team collaboration tools

Access your dashboard at [https://dashboard.hackagent.vistalabs.org](https://dashboard.hackagent.vistalabs.org)

## üß™ Development


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vistalabs-org/hackagent.git
cd hackagent

# Install development dependencies

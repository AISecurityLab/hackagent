# Python SDK API Reference

This section provides detailed documentation for all classes, methods, and functions in the HackAgent Python SDK. This is auto-generated documentation from the source code docstrings.

## What's Included

- **Core Classes**: `HackAgent`, `Client`, `AuthenticatedClient`
- **Attack Framework**: Base classes and strategies for implementing security tests
- **Error Handling**: Exception classes and error handling utilities
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Tools for identifying security weaknesses

## SDK vs HTTP API

This documentation covers the **Python SDK API** - the classes and methods you use when writing Python code with HackAgent. If you're looking for information about raw HTTP endpoints, those are accessed through the SDK and not documented separately at this time.

For practical usage examples and getting started guides, see the [Python SDK Quickstart](../sdk/python-quickstart.md).
